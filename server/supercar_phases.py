"""Deterministic, zero-token phase tracking for Pragya's outbound call.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The UI's SOP tracker used to advance only when the model chose to call
``get_phase_card``. That coupled a *display* concern to a *tool* the model paid
for on every turn, and it failed in the obvious way: the caller said their PIN
code, the model booked correctly, and the tracker still showed Phase 1 because
no tool had been invoked to announce the move.

Phase tracking is therefore derived here, on the server, from what the caller
actually said. It costs zero tokens, zero tools and zero model latency: a
regex pass over a transcript that already exists.

Invariants
----------
* **Monotonic.** A sales funnel only moves forward. A caller circling back to
  models after giving a PIN code has not un-given the PIN code, and a tracker
  that rewinds reads as a bug to anyone watching the demo.
* **Evidence-based.** Phase 4 is reached only by an executed booking, never by
  the caller merely agreeing. The tracker must not be able to claim a booking
  the backend never made.
